Banksy's identity remains unknown, despite intense speculation.
The two names most often suggested are Robert Banks and Robin Gunningham.
Pictures that surfaced of a man who was supposedly Banksy pointed toward Gunningham, an artist who was born in Bristol in 1973.
Gunningham moved to London around 2000, a timeline that correlates with the progression of Banksy's artwork.
